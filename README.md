Fortune Demo
============

I found few clear examples of how to use expressJS with fortune. I was looking to use fortune.js to generate the api for an EmberJS app. I've yet to get the JSONApi adapter working with a non-cli ember app so have commited my current progess to git hub.

Things to look out for in this demo:

- Creation and use of our own express middleware in FortuneJS
- Breaking routes out of the main server.js file 
- Breaking fortune resources out of the main server.js file
- Changing the default templating engine using ejs and ejs-locals

Installation Instructions
------------------------

	git clone https://github.com/ziphrax/fortuneDemo.git
	cd fortuneDemo
	npm install
	npm start


Please feel free to raise any issues on how you feel this can be improved.
